          <h2>About Water On My Block</h2>
          <p>
            <i>Water On My Block</i> was developed by the Greater Chatham Initiative
            and researchers at the University of Chicago and was intended to be
            used by people in greater Chatham. Water On My Block empowers
            residents of Chatham by providing a centralized platform to document
            and track neighborhood flooding incidents. This tool addresses these
            issues by fostering awareness, education, and proactive involvement
            through an accessible, user-friendly interface. An interactive map
            helps visualize flooding hotspots, promoting collective
            responsibility and action, while features like anonymous reporting
            and communication with city officials ensure privacy and encourage
            advocacy.

          <h2>Initial Launch Period and Citizen Science Opportunity</h2>
          <p>
            The initial launch period for <i>Water On My Block</i>  is April 12 through May 31, 2025.
            During this time, University of Chicago researchers will be monitoring the app
            and may make adjustments or fix issues based on feedback. After this period,
            the Greater Chatham Initiative will take ownership of the app and associated
            data. During the initial launch period, climate scientists from Argonne
            National Lab will be measuring flooding in Chatham. If you use the app during
            this time, your flood reports will help the scientists create a more accurate
            picture of flooding in Chicago. All data shared with scientists will be
            anonymized.
