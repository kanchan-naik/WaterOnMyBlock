# WaterOnMyBlock
WaterOnMyBlock is a participatory flood-reporting platform co-designed with Chatham, Chicago residents. It lets users report street or building flooding, view community-submitted reports on a map, and optionally notify aldermen. Built with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Firebase, with privacy and accessibility in mind.
