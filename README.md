# WaterOnMyBlock

## Description

**WaterOnMyBlock** is a community-centered flood reporting platform co-designed with residents of Chatham, Chicago. As climate change intensifies rainfall and aging infrastructure struggles to adapt, local street and basement flooding has become a persistent issue. This web application empowers residents to document and track these incidents in real time, generating community-owned data that can support civic advocacy, scientific research, and infrastructure planning.

The platform allows users to drop a pin on a map, fill out a detailed annotation form (including flood depth, location, water quality, timeline, and cause), and upload photos with customizable privacy settings. Submissions are visualized both as map markers and as a chronological community feed, which residents can browse to stay informed about nearby flooding.

Unlike traditional 311 systems that often exclude or delay citizen reports, WaterOnMyBlock supports both public and private submissions and incorporates participatory features such as anonymous posting and alderman email alerts. The system was developed in collaboration with Argonne National Lab, the Greater Chatham Initiative, and University of Chicago researchers, and was iteratively tested across multiple community engagement events.

## 🏗️ Site Architecture

The application is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), with a mobile-first responsive frontend and a secure REST API backend. It follows a modular folder structure and integrates third-party tools such as the Google Maps Geocoding API for address autofill and browser-image-compression for image optimization.

### 🔹 Frontend Overview (`/frontend`)
The frontend is built with **React (via create-react-app)** and includes custom components, views, context-based stores, and styles. Here's a breakdown of the most important subfolders and files inside `frontend/src/`:

📁 components/
- App.js – Root component that wires up routing, layout, global state, and the welcome popup.
- Navbar.js – Top navigation bar with links, login/logout controls, and responsive layout.
- WelcomePopup.js – Introductory popup shown on first load explaining how to use the app.
- ImageUpload.js – Handles image selection, compression, base64 conversion, and privacy tagging for submissions.

#### 📁 `pages/`
- Full-page views used for routing
- **`AboutUs.js`** – Static informational page about the project’s mission and collaborators
- **`Resources.js`** – List of flooding resources, 311 links, and preparedness tips
- **`Login.js`**, **`Logout.js`**, **`SignUpForm.js`**, **`SignUpFinal.js`** – Auth flow components (account creation, login/logout). `SignUpFinal.js` is the last step of the multi-page sign-up process.
- **`Map.js`** – Interactive map where users drop flood markers and view incident locations
- **`AnnotationForm.js`** – Multi-step submission form used to report floods

#### 📁 `styles/`
- Centralized CSS and custom media queries for responsive styling to accomodate mobile

#### 📁 `images/`
- Static assets like logos, background images, and social cards

#### 📄 `axiosInstance.js`
- Custom Axios wrapper with a predefined `baseURL` and headers
- Used across the app for all API communication with the backend

#### 📄 `firebase.js`
